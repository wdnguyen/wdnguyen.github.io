## Radium and thorium isotopes to quantify salt marsh porewater exchange

I spent the summer of 2019 at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a 
[Summer Student Fellow](https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/educate/undergraduate-programs/summer-student-fellowship/).
My supervisors were Matthew Charette and Joseph Tamborski (now at Old Dominion University). 
For my project, I used a suite of radium and thorium isotopes to quantify water and solute exchange in an intertidal salt marsh.

More coming soon!
