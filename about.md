I'm currently a PhD candidate at The University of Texas at Austin in the Jackson School of Geosciences (2020-Present). 
I received my Bachelors in Geology with Honors at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2020. 

My research interests are in groundwater-surface water interactions, nutrient cycling, and contaminant fate and transport.
I'll currently working on numerical modeling of variably saturated flow and reactive transport of iron-arsenic deposits along the tidal riverbanks of the Meghna River, Bangladesh.
This work is supervised by [M. Bayani Cardenas](http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/cardenas/) and apart of a collaborative research
effort between my institution, Texas A&M University (PI: [Peter Knappett](https://geogeo.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/knappettpeter.html)), and UT San Antonio (PI: [Saugata Datta](https://www.utsa.edu/sciences/labs/SaugataDatta/)). See the award abstract [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1852652&HistoricalAwards=false).

 In my free time, I enjoy baking, playing pickleball, and taking care of my houseplants! <!--- <img src="/images/gengar-sprite.gif" width= "6%" class="align-left" alt=""> -->
