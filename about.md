Hi! I am currently a PhD student at The University of Texas at Austin in the Jackson School of Geosciences (2020-Present). 
I received my Bachelors in Geology with Honors at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2020. 

My research interests are in groundwater-surface water interactions, nutrient cycling, and contaminant fate and transport.
I'll be working on modeling the flow and transport of iron-arsenic deposits along the banks of the Meghna River in Bangladesh.
This work is supervised by [M. Bayani Cardenas](http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/cardenas/) and apart of a collaborative research
effort between my institution, Texas A&M University (PI: Peter Knappett), and UT San Antonio (PI: Saugata Datta). See the award abstract [here](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1852652&HistoricalAwards=false).

In my free time, I'm both an amateur artist and baker. I also dabble in video games! <img src="/images/gengar-sprite.gif" width= "6%" class="align-left" alt="">
